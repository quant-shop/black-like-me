Despite growing attention to global exchanges in teacher training, few studies focus on teachers’ understanding of cultural differences, diaspora, and the role of HBCUs in advancing diaspora literacy. This project explores how international engagements shape educators’ awareness of the African diaspora and informs our practice.

## Project Description

Diasporic awareness involves understanding shared histories and cultural practices resulting from migration (Boutte, Johnson, & Muki, 2019; Zeleza, 2009). This study draws on frameworks from diaspora and Black internationalism studies, emphasizing the role of HBCUs in diaspora literacy and educator preparation. Using a mixed-methods longitudinal design, the project combines international surveys and cohort narratives studying how educators’ diasporic awareness shapes professional visions and practices. Findings will support new survey tools, educational modules, research in teacher internationalization, and an open-source project advancing diaspora literacy and global competence in education.

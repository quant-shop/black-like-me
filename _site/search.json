    "text": "Problem Statement and Project Significance\nDespite growing attention to global exchanges in teacher training, few studies focus on teachers’ understanding of cultural differences, diaspora, and the role of HBCUs in advancing diaspora literacy. This study explores how international engagements shape elementary educators’ awareness of the African diaspora and affect their teaching practice.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nHow do global studies in educator preparation relate to teachers’ diasporic awareness and perceptions of practices centering African diaspora histories and cultures?\nAre there distinct profiles in educators’ knowledge and beliefs about the African diaspora based on identity and background?\nHow do HBCU pre-service teachers’ narratives about professional identity evolve with diasporic engagement?\n\n\n\nTheoretical and Conceptual Frameworks\nDiasporic awareness involves understanding shared histories and cultural practices resulting from migration (Boutte, Johnson, & Muki, 2019; Zeleza, 2009). This study draws on frameworks from diaspora and Black internationalism studies, emphasizing the role of HBCUs in diaspora literacy and educator preparation.\n\n\nSummary of Research Design\nUsing a mixed-methods longitudinal design, the project combines international surveys and cohort narratives studying how educators’ diasporic awareness shapes professional visions and practices.\n\n\nHow the Field Will Be Different\nFindings will support new survey tools, educational modules, research in teacher internationalization, and an open-source project advancing diaspora literacy and global competence in education.",

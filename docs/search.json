    "text": "The concept of diaspora, especially within the African diaspora, encompasses shared histories, cultural connections, and experiences of displacement that inform identity and practice. Recent scholarship (Edwards, 2001; Zeleza, 2009; Urrieta, 2016) elaborates this as an evolving understanding shaped through multiple geographies and sociopolitical contexts.\n\nThe Role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)\nHBCUs have played a crucial role in advancing diaspora literacy and cultural competence. Their teacher education programs intentionally incorporate situated pedagogy and cultural knowledge that center Black histories and diasporic experiences (Anderson, 1988; Lee, 2019; Hope, 2022).\n\n\nDiasporic Awareness in Teacher Preparation\nUnderstanding cultural variations within the diaspora is critical for educators engaging with diverse classrooms. This awareness supports more inclusive, reflective, and informed pedagogical practices and professional identities.\n\n\nInternational Engagements and Global Competence\nInternational experiences—whether in-person, virtual, or hybrid—offer significant opportunities for teachers to deepen their diasporic awareness and reshape perceptions of classroom practice, fostering critical global competence.\n\n\nLiterature Overview\nWhile existing literature addresses globalization in teacher education and racialization, there is limited focus specifically on diaspora literacy and the transnational realities influencing educators’ approaches to practice (Apple, 2011; Howard & Rosario, 2000; Mensah, 2022; Wallace et al., 2021).",

    "text": "Problem Statement and Project Significance\nDespite growing attention to global exchanges in teacher training, few studies focus on teachers’ understanding of cultural differences, diaspora, and the role of HBCUs in advancing diaspora literacy. This study explores how international engagements shape elementary educators’ awareness of the African diaspora and affect their teaching practice.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nHow do global studies in educator preparation relate to teachers’ diasporic awareness and perceptions of practices centering African diaspora histories and cultures?\nAre there distinct profiles in educators’ knowledge and beliefs about the African diaspora based on identity and background?\nHow do HBCU pre-service teachers’ narratives about professional identity evolve with diasporic engagement?\n\n\n\nTheoretical and Conceptual Frameworks\nDiasporic awareness involves understanding shared histories and cultural practices resulting from migration (Boutte, Johnson, & Muki, 2019; Zeleza, 2009). This study draws on frameworks from diaspora and Black internationalism studies, emphasizing the role of HBCUs in diaspora literacy and educator preparation.\n\n\nSummary of Research Design\nUsing a mixed-methods longitudinal design, the project combines international surveys and cohort narratives studying how educators’ diasporic awareness shapes professional visions and practices.\n\n\nHow the Field Will Be Different\nFindings will support new survey tools, educational modules, research in teacher internationalization, and an open-source project advancing diaspora literacy and global competence in education.",

    "text": "Background and Context\nThe concept of diaspora, especially within the African diaspora, encompasses shared histories, cultural connections, and experiences of displacement that inform identity and practice. Recent scholarship (Edwards, 2001; Zeleza, 2009; Urrieta, 2016) elaborates this as an evolving understanding shaped through multiple geographies and sociopolitical contexts.\n\n\nThe Role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)\nHBCUs have played a crucial role in advancing diaspora literacy and cultural competence. Their teacher education programs intentionally incorporate situated pedagogy and cultural knowledge that center Black histories and diasporic experiences (Anderson, 1988; Lee, 2019; Hope, 2022).\n\n\nDiasporic Awareness in Teacher Preparation\nUnderstanding cultural variations within the diaspora is critical for educators engaging with diverse classrooms. This awareness supports more inclusive, reflective, and informed pedagogical practices and professional identities.\n\n\nInternational Engagements and Global Competence\nInternational experiences—whether in-person, virtual, or hybrid—offer significant opportunities for teachers to deepen their diasporic awareness and reshape perceptions of classroom practice, fostering critical global competence.\n\n\nLiterature Overview\nWhile existing literature addresses globalization in teacher education and racialization, there is limited focus specifically on diaspora literacy and the transnational realities influencing educators’ approaches to practice (Apple, 2011; Howard & Rosario, 2000; Mensah, 2022; Wallace et al., 2021).",

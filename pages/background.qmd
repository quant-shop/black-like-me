title: Background and Context
---

The concept of diaspora, especially within the African diaspora, encompasses shared histories, cultural connections, and experiences of displacement that inform identity and practice. Recent scholarship (Edwards, 2001; Zeleza, 2009; Urrieta, 2016) elaborates this as an evolving understanding shaped through multiple geographies and sociopolitical contexts.

While existing literature addresses globalization in teacher education and racialization, there is limited focus specifically on diaspora literacy and the transnational realities influencing educators' approaches to practice (Apple, 2011; Howard & Rosario, 2000; Mensah, 2022; Wallace et al., 2021).

## Diasporic Awareness in Teacher Preparation

Understanding cultural variations within the diaspora is critical for educators engaging with diverse classrooms. This awareness supports more inclusive, reflective, and informed pedagogical practices and professional identities.

## International Engagements and Global Competence

International experiences—whether in-person, virtual, or hybrid—offer significant opportunities for teachers to deepen their diasporic awareness and reshape perceptions of classroom practice, fostering critical global competence.
